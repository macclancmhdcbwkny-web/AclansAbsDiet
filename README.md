## Firebase sync setup

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Add a Web App in Firebase project settings.
3. Copy the Firebase config object.
4. Enable Authentication > Email/Password sign-in.
5. Create a Firestore database.
6. Use Firestore rules that only allow each signed-in user to access their own document:

```text
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /absDietUsers/{userId}/data/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

7. Open this app, paste the config into `Firebase Cloud Sync`, then click `Save Firebase config`.
8. Enter your email and password, then click `Create account` once.
9. Click `Upload local data` first from the device that already has your tracker history.
10. On another device, use the same Firebase config, sign in with the same email/password, then click `Download cloud data` or `Sync both ways`.

After the Firebase config is saved and you sign in once on a device, the app checks Firebase's saved browser session each time it opens and reconnects automatically when that session is still valid. You should not need to paste the JSON again after ordinary app updates. If you clear browser data, switch browsers, use private browsing, or Firebase signs you out, open the settings and sign in again.

The app syncs one Firestore document per Firebase user account. Use email/password sign-in if you want to recover your data after clearing browser data. Anonymous sign-in is included only for quick testing because anonymous identity can be lost when browser data is cleared.

## Calendar behavior

The app opens to the computer's current date. Picking another date changes the diet day to that calendar date's weekday. If you choose a date other than today, the app reminds you which weekday diet you are viewing.

## Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload `index.html`, `README.md`, `.nojekyll`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `site.webmanifest`, and the full `assets/` folder.
3. In GitHub, open `Settings` > `Pages`.
4. Set `Source` to `Deploy from a branch`.
5. Choose the `main` branch and `/root`, then save.
6. Open the published Pages URL on your iPhone.

## iPhone note

The app stores progress in the browser and can sync that progress between your iPhone and computer when Firebase Cloud Sync is connected with the same account.

## Easy local start

Double-click `Start ABS App.command` in this folder. It opens the app on your Mac and prints the iPhone URL for the same Wi-Fi network. Keep that Terminal window open while using the app.
