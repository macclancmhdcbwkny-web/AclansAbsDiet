## Firebase sync setup

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Add a Web App in Firebase project settings.
3. Put the Firebase config object in the app source as `FIREBASE_CONFIG`.
4. Enable Authentication > Email/Password sign-in.
5. Create a Firestore database.
6. Use Firestore rules that only allow each signed-in user to access their own document:

```text
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /absDietUsers/{userId}/data/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

7. Open this app and enter your email and password in `Firebase Cloud Sync`.
8. Click `Create Account` once, or `Sign In` if the account already exists.
9. Use the same email/password on another device to sync the same saved tracker data.

After you sign in once on a device, the app checks Firebase's saved browser session each time it opens and reconnects automatically when that session is still valid. If you clear browser data, switch browsers, use private browsing, or Firebase signs you out, sign in again with the same email/password.

The app syncs one Firestore document per Firebase user account. Use email/password sign-in if you want to recover your data after clearing browser data.

## Calendar behavior

The app opens to the computer's current date. Picking another date changes the diet day to that calendar date's weekday. If you choose a date other than today, the app reminds you which weekday diet you are viewing.

## Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload `index.html`, `README.md`, `.nojekyll`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `site.webmanifest`, and the full `assets/` folder.
3. In GitHub, open `Settings` > `Pages`.
4. Set `Source` to `Deploy from a branch`.
5. Choose the `main` branch and `/root`, then save.
6. Open the published Pages URL on your iPhone.

## iPhone note

The app stores progress in the browser and can sync that progress between your iPhone and computer when Firebase Cloud Sync is connected with the same account.

## Easy local start

Double-click `Start ABS App.command` in this folder. It opens the app on your Mac and prints the iPhone URL for the same Wi-Fi network. Keep that Terminal window open while using the app.
